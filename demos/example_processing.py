\section{Multiplicity and interpretation}

We pre-specify the Cram\'er--von Mises statistic as the primary test. Secondary tests include the moment-cascade GMM and the low-compliance falsification. We adjust for multiplicity by Romano--Wolf stepdown using common bootstrap resamples. We complement p-values with effect-size metrics: the sup-gap \(\|\hat\Delta\|_\infty = \sup_y |\hat\Delta(y)|\), the integrated gap \(\|\hat\Delta\|_2^2 = \int \hat\Delta(y)^2\,d\hat H(y)\), and an explained-share index
\[
R^2_{\text{CDF}} \equiv 1 - 
\frac{\int\!\big(\hat F_{Y\mid Z=1}-\hat F_{Y\mid Z=0} - \hat p_C(\hat F_{1C}-\hat F_{0C})\big)^2\,d\hat H}
{\int\!\big(\hat F_{Y\mid Z=1}-\hat F_{Y\mid Z=0}\big)^2\,d\hat H}.
\]
If results conflict, we interpret according to location. A global rejection with a local acceptance suggests diffuse violations. A local rejection with a global acceptance suggests violations concentrated where compliance is low.

With exclusion restriction violations where gamma equals 0.2, power increases modestly to around 10% for both tests. However, with stronger violations where gamma equals 0.5, both tests achieve perfect power, rejecting the null hypothesis in 100% of simulations.
